# Movie-DB
### The web app project is divided into two major chunks
- Web app UI
- Custom Hooks
### UI Components
    The UI components follow a flow.
    1. The web app consists of a Layout component which has a header component in it.
    2. the rest of the space is reserved for the content area.
    3. The content area is switched from home page to the movie details page or to actor details page using react-router.
#### The UI components are segregated based on 4 types
- Basic UI ( more on UI components [here](https://github.com/abhishekbane/movie-db/tree/main/src/components/UI) )
