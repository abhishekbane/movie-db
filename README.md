### The web app project is divided into three major chunks

- Web app UI
- Custom Hooks

### UI Components
    The UI components follow a flow.
    1. The web app consists of a Layout component which has a header component in it and the remaining space is filled by dynamically passing page content.
    2. The page content is switched from home page to the movie details page or to actor details page using react-router.
    
#### The UI components are segregated based on 3 types.
- Basic UI
- components
- containers
- hoc
    
### Custom hooks
    The hooks are used to fetched filtered data or to search movies based on user keywords.
